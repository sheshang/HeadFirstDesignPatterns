# Decorator Pattern
It is a pattern that attach additional responsibilities to the object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to the subclassing for extending functionality.

Example: 1) Starbuzz coffee cafe for extensibility of condiments over base coffees.
         2) Custom IO wrapper over standard Java IO classes.
