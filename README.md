# Decorator Pattern
It is a pattern that attach additional responsibilities to the object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to the subclassing for extending functionality.

Example: Starbuzz coffee cafe for extensibility of condiments over base coffees.

         Custom IO wrapper over standard Java IO classes.
