# Command Pattern:
it encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Example: Home automation Remote Control API

# Meta Command Pattern:
it allows you to create macros of commands so that you can execute multiple commands at once.

Example: Party mode conversion by single button press.
