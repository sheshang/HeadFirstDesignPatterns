# Factory Method Pattern
It defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclass decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instatiation to subclass.

Example: Pizza Store chains with its frenchise in multiple US states.

# Abstract Factory Method Pattern
It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Example: Pizza store with abstract factory for ingredient creations.
